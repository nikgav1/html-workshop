        <p>Preference for Solitude
The sigma male is no social butterfly, and no one expects them to be. They may be bored or disinterested in large social settings and feel most comfortable alone or with a small group of people they’ve come to know well. </p>

        <p>Strong Sense of Self

Sigma males also called “lone wolves,” have been around for a long time, but we are now hearing more about them because of social media and the internet.

        <p>Origin of the Term
The term “sigma male” is relatively new but has quickly become popular and part of our everyday speak. Categorizing men into different archetypes, however, isn’t new.

Over the years, we’ve tried to classify men into different groups based on their behavior or their roles in society. You’ve probably heard of the alpha male, who is seen as the leader, and the beta male, who is more of a collaborator or follower.2

Men who didn’t quite fit into either of these categories identify more as sigma males. Sigmas can be successful and influential without leading a group or following others. </p>
